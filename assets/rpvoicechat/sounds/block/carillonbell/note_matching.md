# Music note matching for carillon bells

A small explanation about music note matching with metal used for carillon bell molding.

## Description

In order not to modify the "SoundEmittingBlock" class which expects an array of sounds in order to randomize the reading on one of the sounds, 
we preferred to rename the sound files of the chime bell by naming them according to the metal used, making the name of the note played disappear in the name of the sound file. Below, a table lists the available notes according to the metal.
